title: 5 Months Old!
---
The 5/12ths birthday was pretty rough.  It was the 4th night of waking up around 2am (luckily, she broke the streak on the night of the 22nd).  She was pretty unhappy all day.  Luckily, she gave us a few minutes to take her 5 months pictures.  And, to skip ahead, the 23rd was a return to happy form.

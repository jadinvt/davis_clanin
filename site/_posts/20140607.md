title: Splash Pad and Tooth!
---
Another Summer water spot in Austin is the splash pad, which I think they invented in 2007 when property values were going toward 0 and the city couldn't afford to maintain the city pools.  Anyhow, splash pads are great for tiny people.  Honora was very entertained.<br/>

I noticed this on the way to the splash pad.  Honora's been a little drooly/chewy the last few days; otherwise, this tooth came in without too much todo.

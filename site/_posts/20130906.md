For the third time ever, we strapped Honora into the carseat-torture device and headed out.  This time for a walk around the lake at Mueller.  It was lovely if a bit humid.

Before coming home, we stopped for breakfast tacos at Pacos.  Honora was totally cool even though it felt a little cruel to eat tacos in front of somebody on a milk-only diet.

The rest of the day was spent in default mammal mode, snuggling.

Here's a couple of pics of our mutual favorite carrying position; I've termed it the "monkey hold".  I started using this for burping, but Honora liked it so much (i.e. fell immediately asleep so frequently), that I use it now most of the time I'm carrying her.  It's extra enjoyable now with her free arm draped over mine

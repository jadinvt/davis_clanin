## Part Two: Ask me about my epidural!

For some background, Jad and I had taken a hypnobirthing class and we were hoping for a low medical intervention birth. However, having worked at a freestanding birth center and assisting in around 80 births I knew birth was unpredictable.  I had seen people get transferred to the hospital when their labors went really long or there were other complications. These couples often looked extremely disappointed as they left, you could see on their faces they felt like they had “failed.” The stress of having to transfer to the hospital during labor and being delivered by a doctor who doesn’t know you (and may be slightly annoyed to see you) wasn’t something I was willing to risk.  

Luckily I had the option of being seen at Nurture, a practice with a certified nurse-midwife and two obgyns who were very progressive and also interested in low intervention birth. Their c-section rate is around 10%, with the national average being around 30%.  Like I said, they were comfortable with me staying home for up to 18 hours after my water broke, many doctors would have wanted me to come in right away and start the induction process at midnight.  


Back to the pitocin...so like I said at 1 pm they finally started the pitocin. At first I was laying on the bed, able to breath through the contractions without too much trouble. Eventually I had to stand up beside the bed and and sway back and forth, or turn around and place my hands on the hospital bed and rock my hips back and forth.  This worked for a while. I also sat on the birth ball we had brought for a while. I was able to use the breathing and relaxation techniques we had learned in class effectively.  Eventually I began to look longingly at the large shower, I wasn’t sure if I could get it or not being hooked up to the pitocin and monitors.

I texted my midwife, who said I absolutely could. My nurse got me hooked up to the wireless monitors so I could get in the shower. Jad held the water on my lower back when I had a contraction and I held onto the shower bars while standing up.  The water felt soooo good and really helped me tolerate the contractions for a while. I tried sitting in the shower chair when I had been standing for a while but that proved to be a mistake when the contractions came, they were way more painful than standing.  All the while my nurse had been slowly turning up my pitocin.  It was around 4 o'clock that the wheels started to come off the bus and I started thinking in terms of the Hyperbole and a Half pain scale.  I had shot right past “my pain is not fucking around now” and gone straight too “too serious for numbers” within a couple of hours.  

My legs were also feeling shaky. Somewhere my nurse brain was saying “this is transition”, the period of labor before active pushing begins but I just couldn’t believe it because I had only been in real active labor for three hours.  Let me tell you, there was no “staring at a candle” or “focal point” and breathing through this shit. There was no level of conscious thought now, just a vague will to survive and ride through each contraction until it passed. I started making low guttural noises I remember. 

At this point, I asked for an epidural.  The pain was just completely unbearable and I didn’t care if I had five more minutes of labor or five more hours, I needed the pain to stop.  My midwife came in and helped me get through a contraction, she offered a cervical exam but I told her I didn’t care, I wanted the epidural.  Again, in retrospect, I was probably fairly close to pushing and having my baby. However, I’m still really glad I got the epidural because I was able to be fully present for pushing and the birth of my baby.  

I’m fairly certain I would have been solely focused on surviving the pain had I not had the epidural.  They called for the anesthesiologist and started giving me the two bags of IV fluids I needed to get the epidural.  I had to ride out a few more contractions in the shower.  Probably after about 20 minutes I dried off and moved back to bed for the doctor. He seemed very young, he asked me “Have you ever had an epidural before?” I said no and he replied “You’re gonna love it!” You have to hunch your back over and remain perfectly still while the doctor places the needle and catheter in your back. 

I was really worried about being able to be still at this point because the contractions were so incredibly intense. I hunched over and grabbed my nurse’s and Jad’s forearms and held on for dear life while I had another contraction. After that the doctor placed the epidural, it felt very very strange but not particularly painful.  After that I was told to lay on my back while they monitored my blood pressure to make sure it didn’t drop too low, a common  complication.  Blissfully, the pain started to recede.

I tolerated the epidural well and didn’t have any side effects. Shortly thereafter I started to feel a lot of pressure in my vagina and rectum, I knew this meant it might be getting time to push. My nurse commented on the pattern of the baby’s heartbeat and said it looked like I might be getting fully dilated.  One of the doctors of my practice, Dr. Blake, came in and checked my cervix and said I was complete! She said she would call Liane, the nurse-midwife to let her know and Liane would come and deliver the baby.  

A little bit of backstory, Liane and I had worked together for 2.5 years at another OBGYN practice and had become good friends. She had said from the beginning that she would be at my birth if at all possible. This was so incredibly comforting to me,  to know I had someone who truly cared about me at my birth and who I knew who would do everything in her power to ensure we had a good experience.  At this point I rested comfortably and we waited for Liane to arrive.

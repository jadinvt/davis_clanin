<p>New obvious toy: solo cups.  We have 10 thousand of these and Honora loves them.</p>

In a manner consistent with other aspects of our lives, Alisa and I tend to parent one day at a time.  It occurred to me that, at some point, Honora is going to need to put away her own toys.  Just for fun I brought all the legos over to her and started putting them in their container.  She pitched right in.  Parenting objective: met.  I'm sure it will always be this easy.

<p> Honora has a little music player that she's plays for us all the time.  There are enough songs of enough complexity for it to be palatable--or the aural equivalent.  The dancing doesn't hurt.

title: Eye (Honora's words)
---
<p>Starting a couple weeks ago, Honora's been rolling out quite the vocabulary.  Besides "Mama" and "Papa," not many words
stuck with her.  In October, she was saying "truck," "cat" and "duck," but "truck" went away and "duck" became "da."  In mid-November,
she starting making the "oo" sound and she was off to the races, "moo," "boo," "woof", "hiss," "baa," and "neigh" made the animal-sounds books
much cuter reading.  She learned "deer" ("dee") when Clarice came home from Target.  Dolly is "Doll," Jojo is "Dodo," and birds are "boow."  Also funny is "poo," which she can also sign.

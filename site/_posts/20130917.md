title: Bathtime and Sundry Cuteness
---

The title is a bit misleading.  Today was Honora's first full immersion (other than breathing parts) bath.  Due partly to our laissez-faire tendencies and partly to the fact that babies don't get dirty, we've pretty much stuck to spot-cleaning any problem areas and avoiding the whole bathing to-do.  After a pretty impressive diaper blowout (not pictured), we figured it would probably save us alot of wet-nap money if we gave her a bath.

She took to it pretty well, though we didn't realize the tub had a plug.  In the end, she was not nearly as submerged as she wanted and was also not a huge fan of being dried off (pictured below).  As to the misleading title, photo #2 is the only bath related pic.  Sorry about that.

Uncle Donald and Aunt Lacy brought over a delicious peppery chicken pasta dish and some beer.  I think there's a forthcoming picture of Lacy, who baby wrangled for a bit.

### Milestones
* First full immersion bath 
* Beginning male-pattern baldness.  Honora didn't have much hair to being with, but now she's straight-bald on top.

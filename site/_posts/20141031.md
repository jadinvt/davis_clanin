<p>It's poor form to take your child trick-or-treating before they can eat candy; we decided to wait until next year for that.  Honora was actually in bed before the first trick-or-treaters arrived at our door.  It was mostly a non-event for her.  Though she did get to take a crack a pizza crust, which was, according to our sample-size-1-taste-test, better than Cheerios.

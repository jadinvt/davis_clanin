Fun day.  We were going to grab some breakfast tacos, drop mama off at the Opt[ometrist|ician] and go for a walk around the Mueller pond/lake.  Oddly enough, it was raining, so we played in the car for awhile and then auto-toured a [strange little Austin neighborhood](https://maps.google.com/?ll=30.302641,-97.711179&spn=0.00641,0.006759&t=h&z=17) I hadn't been to before (between Mueller, Airport and I-35).  The rest of the day, we dozed and watched the rain/thunderstorm.  Lovely.

A(nother) nice low-key day.  Honora has been spending more time out-of-swaddle.  For awhile, she seemed unhappy unless she was bundled up, but now she seems to like spending 20 or 30 minutes free until she tires and requests to be wrapped back up--usually for some sleeping.  

Luckily we have several beautiful blankets for her to lounge on.  The pictures below feature a quilt sewn by Alisa's long time friend and my former boss[^1], Angel Funk.  To top the day off Whitney Thurman brought by a heavenly spinach-pesto lasagna.

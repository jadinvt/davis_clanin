title: Happy Thanksgiving!
---
Aunt Lisa and Uncle Matt had us over for Thanksgiving which is the _non plus ultra_ of holiday feasts.  The food and company was fantastic as always at chez Malisa.  Honora made friends with Matt's mom Marcy who managed to take her from stranger-danger crying to a 30 minute nap in short order.

<p> Not photographed, but worth bookmarking was a terrifying tantrum that Honora had last night around midnight.  She woke up screaming like I've never heard and kept at it for nearly 30 minutes.  It took another 30 minutes of walking (just like the old days!) to get her calmed down and an hour to get her back to sleep.  According to the doctor and the internet, this is completely normal and we're just lucky this is the first time we've seen it.  It's (apparently) just teething (molars coming in) crossed with an oncoming developmental stage where she's more likely to express pain or frustration in trantrum form.  Should be a good time.  Seriously, she's spoiled us pretty well so far.</p>

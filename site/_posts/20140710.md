The Taylors have a lovely home, and with presence of water and absent the burning Texas sun, sitting outside was lovely, even after dawn.

Townes was a very gracious host and let Honora play with all his stuff.

Multiple generations of Taylors came over for a impromptu family reunion/bbq that Josh and Kristi put together.  Honora met quite a few cousins, great uncles, and even a great, great uncle.  While she held up pretty well in familiar arms, she wasn't very keen on being passed around.  Plus she had to retire around 9.  That's my excuse for not having taken pictures.  Here she is at the beginning of the night.

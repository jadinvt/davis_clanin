On day 2 of crawling, Honora was introduced to the goalpost-moving parent.  Here, Honora is chasing her music player.  After reaching it, we're treated

<p>In other news, it's time for my quarterly shearing and I wanted
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k0fnTiKEMc">avoid this at all costs</a>, so I cut my hair and beard off in front of Honora.  Despite this 
precaution, I was in the "stranger danger" zone for a few hours.</p>

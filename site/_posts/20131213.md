We've managed to tag-team our way to avoiding a shopping trip with Honora for this long.  Today, we decided to give it a go.  She slept most of the way through target and required "the floating chair," (which is the crook-of-my-arm hold that the ["monkey hold"](http://honora.davisclanin.com/stories/2013/09/06/big-day-out/) has grown into) while in the grocery store.  She also needed to sit in my lap during lunch, which is totally fine with me :)

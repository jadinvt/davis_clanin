Despite not being able to locomote, Honora sometimes squirms around like I've seen other
children do to be let down.  I've tried to explain that she's just going to be stuck wherever
she's put, but she doesn't listen to reason.  The other funny thing she does along these lines
is point her head where she wants to go (usually Mama), she'll lay in my arms horizontally, with
her head pointed at Alisa as if she going to teleport across the distance between us.

We have had a solid string of visitors bringing well-wishes, adoration (for Honora, they're understandably less impressed with us) and all manner of delicious and sustaining food.  Tonight, a world-travelling Chris Cain was in town and stopped by to pay his respects.  He and Honora got along well.

### Milestones
* First seemed to notice the woodland creatures hanging in front of her in the buzzie chair (documentation attempt failed.)

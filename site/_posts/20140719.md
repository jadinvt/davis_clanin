title: "HM2SET, Day 11: Gigglefest" 
---
Many fun things happened today, but without a doubt the day will be most remembered for the 10+ minute gigglefest inspired by NaNa with the help of a particularly hilarious stuffed bear.  The video is just Honora; to get an idea of the set-up here's a picture.

Honora likes to throw/roll a ball back and forth.  Toward the bottom of the frame you can see the bear.  He sat the first part of the game out.  At some point, NaNa animated the bear, picking up and throwing the ball with his paws.  Honora thought this was really funny.  She has never laughed like this before.  In fact, she rarely does more than a single "heh," regardless of how extraordinarily funny we're being.  Anyway, without futher ado:

Took another walk today, we had to borrow warm clothes and the temperature barely cracked 60.  It was heaven.

Honora had a good time riding my rocking horse.

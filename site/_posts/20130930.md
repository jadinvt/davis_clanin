title: Changing Table
---
A good percentage of our pics, and almost all of our smile pics, take place on Honora's changing table.  It's her happy place.  She can be in any state of upset; when we lay her on the table, she becomes immediately tranquil.  We got some nice covers; it almost looks like an intentional background (sort of, sometimes, with the occasional wet-wipes or diaper in the background.)

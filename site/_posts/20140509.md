title: Visit to Nurture and Blocks!
---

<a href="http://www.nurtureobgyn.com/">Nurture</a> moved to a new, amazing office.  We got a chance to visit and hang out with Liane.  Thanks for bringing Honora into the world safe and sound!

This is Honora's favorite (really, her only) magic trick, the spooooky levitating block.  It is kindof cool since Alisa and my thumbs are to big to replicate the trick.

After the show, there's still plenty to do.  I think I actually have the order backwards since she's wearing pants below and not above.  This entry is more of a memoir, I suppose, than a biography.

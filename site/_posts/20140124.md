Not enough snow to do much with, by the time we got out it was melted.  
Honora has cycled back to the p,b,m front of mouth raspberry/farting sound, which, frankly,
is my favorite.

In the last week or 10 days, we've started doing various gentle airplane/swing-up-the-air thing.  Honora's
neck seems up to the task and she loves it.  It's brought her back "from the edge" a couple of times.

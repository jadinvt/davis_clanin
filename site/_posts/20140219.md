title: Feb. 19, Pic of the Day

Honora's been sleeping well since [the post-Superbowl sleep trauma](/stories/2014/02/04/feb-04-pic-of-the-day/).  Until last night, anyway.  Pictured below is Honora around 6am in the morning after having not gone to bed until 10:30pm.  I pointed out that she'd probably be happier if she'd gone to bed earlier.  I then reflected on the fact that, after nearly 40 years, I still routinely disregard that bit of wisdom.
<p>
Lately (1 month+?), I haven't had any luck rocking/walking her to sleep.  Only Alisa can get her to sleep.  For awhile there, she was going to sleep on her own (sort of, we waited until she was pretty knocked out), but that behavior has stopped as well.

We've also been trying to get her to nap independently (i.e. not on Mama) during the day.  She'll sleep for 30 or 45 minutes, but not much longer.  We don't seem to have a sleeper on our hands . . .

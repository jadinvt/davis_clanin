title: Dress-up and a Visit from Tia Aimee
---

I was asleep for a large part of the day after being up pretty late last night.  Interestingly, it was a Cisco router and not Honora that had me up (though she helped troubleshoot in her buzzie chair).

While I was out, Tia Aimee came over to visit Alisa and Honora.  Later, Honora tried on some clothes for Mama.

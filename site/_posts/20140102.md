In "Cats in the Cradle" fashion, I was at work today while Honora made some (relatively) huge developmental leaps in movement and manipulation (of objects, she's already mastered control of her parents).

First off she completely owned this block.  It's the first non-hanging object she's grabbed (that we didn't put in her hand).

Then in the floor exercises, she just . . . about . . . rolled over.  Alisa reported that this process was accompanied by much grunting and effort.

Honora has learned to wiggle/squirm her way short distances and out of low-level confinement (the buzzie chair, the floating chair, etc.)  Here's a good example:

Also interesting is that she hadn't tried to roll over in weeks.  I'm guessing it's typical; she tries something (rolling over, and various vocalizations come to mind) for a couple hours or a day, and then lays off of it for awhile.

title: Pumpkin Carving
---
Today was Honora's first social outing; we went to the annual Steptonixander (formerly Steptonia) Halloween Pumpkin Carving extravaganza.  In years past (many years past at this point), the event was marked by highly intricate pumpkin carving (with Stephen employing the messy-but-effective dremmel tool method), bourbon and more bourbon.  The last year or three have been far more child-centric with drastically more reasonable levels of bourbon consumption.  This was the perfect venue to debut our adorable, recently vaccinated child.  

Honora had a lovely time meeting everybody, getting some licks from Mo (who is a dog, thankfully) sleeping (mostly), and looking around; we stayed much longer than we had anticipated.  It was pretty perfect.  Next year we should have it together enough to manage costumes.

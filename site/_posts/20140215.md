title: Exploring the Super-Saucer 
---
I don't know what this thing is called.  It was a gift-me-down from
Xander, Antonia and Stephen.  It looks like the control panel of a 
super-fun space pod.  It's Honora's first toy with 
the push-button, get-lights-and-sounds scheme.  She's a huge fan.

Somehow the Jungle with it's light/sound-lessness just isn't as exciting anymore . . .

Alright, maybe the Jungle is still fun too.

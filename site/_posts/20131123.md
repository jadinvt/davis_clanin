title: Nov. 23, Pic of the Day

I haven't caught it on camera yet, but the last couple of days, Honora has been checking out the dogs.  Obviously, they've been hanging out the entire time, often within inches of her (or less, in the case of licking), but she hasn't looked at/tracked them at all.  Grabbing the dogs is only weeks away.  Here are some pictures from today of her not noticing the dogs.

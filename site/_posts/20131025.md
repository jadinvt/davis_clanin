Honora slept nearly 15 of the last 24 hours.  She'd been awake alot last weekend, including overnight.  Earlier in the week, she resumed a normal(er) pattern.  Last night, she went to sleep after eating around 10pm.  She woke up to eat around 6am and 9am, but otherwise kept sleeping.  We planned on going to lunch when she got up which ende up being 2:30pm today.  I guess she had some catching up to do.

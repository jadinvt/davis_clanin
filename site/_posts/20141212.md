title: Meeting Rody
---
<p>
Honora has developed enough height and balance to play on the "Racing Rodys" at the Thinkery.  I wasn't there for the adventure, but Mama reported that Honora progressively unseated all the other children by using her teeny-tiny cuteness to charm the other parents into pulling their own children off of their Rody when Honora expressed interest in it.  Honora continually expressed interest in a Rody she wasn't currently on.

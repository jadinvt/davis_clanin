title: A whole new play/photo-scape

Now that Honora can see farther than 18 inches, she's checking out a new laying-about area.  Expect to see a whole lot more of it for the next . . . couple hundred pictures or so.

Honora got a taste of ACL (music festival) in the last 24 hours via live stream.  It's hard to tell, but she seemed to like Wilco and the Cure best.  To be fair, Vampire Weekend had the handicap of playing during a traumatic diaper change. 

The evening ended with a fantastic thunderstorm.  Honora twitched during the big booms; it seems her imperviousness to loud sounds may be ending.

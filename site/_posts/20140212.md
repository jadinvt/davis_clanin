title: Bumbo 
---
The "Bumbo" was a gift-me-down from Amelia, George and Whitney.  It's a seat with a deep bowl that lets Honora sit on her own.  She'll sit in it happily for quite a while (10 - 30 minutes).

<p>
Skip on ahead to the adorable pictures if you're feeling at all averse to scatological humor . . . There's been a funny coincidence or a pattern that we've just picked up on.  After not having a bowel movement for a couple of days, Honora pooped while in the Bumbo.  The next day it happened again.  In the last week, the majority of her 2's have been sitting in the Bumbo.  There's some speculation we found online that something about the squat/sitting position of the Bumbo encourages pooping.  In any case, we've now euphamized the term "Bumbo," as in "to take a bumbo," or "Honora smells like bumbo."

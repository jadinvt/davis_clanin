<p>
Today we left our Ashville bungalo and headed down to see NaNa and Poppy in north Georgia.  Either she remembered them from their visit last year (less likely) or their professional grandparent standing along with her growing comfort with first encounters smoothed our entry.  Honora was playing with Nana in no time.  This was going to be fun.

<p>After her <a href="http://honora.davisclanin.com/stories/2014/11/21/brief-visit-to-the-texas-history-museum/">
50 yard dash outside the History Museum</a>, I thought maybe Honora was a bit constrained by the living room.  
Unfortunately, our yard in mostly made out of weeds that reproduce via burrs, so I took her to Mueller and put
her in the grass.  She did eventually crawl around a little, but was pretty absorbed with the novelty of grass, leaves,
and acorns in her immediate vicinity.</p>

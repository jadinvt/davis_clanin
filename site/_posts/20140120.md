title: Lunch with Juliana
---
Juliana came over for lunch (she brought Mandola's) and she and Alisa talked for a long while Honora played in the "jungle." Honora then sat on Alisa's lap, smiling and giggling while Juliana admired her and we chatted some more. They then went for a walk around Mueller, but Honora was unhappy so we only walked for about 30 minutes. (Jad was at work, but got a giggly greeting as seen below).

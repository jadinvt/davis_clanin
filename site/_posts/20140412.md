title: Urban Exploring--Road to Nowhere in the Other Direction

From the access trail at our local YMCA, we can travel toward either undesireable destination (we're about 1/2 way between them).  Today, with bedtime only 45 minutes away, we decided to take a 1.5 hour walk in the direction we didn't go last time.  It all turned out well.

What's that fan going to do next?  Unrelated, Honora usually falls asleep on Alisa between 8 and 10 and we put her in the bassinet.  Occasionally, she wakes up *en route*, and we get to test her ability to fall asleep "on her own."  Previously, she would stay awake until we picked her back up, but tonight, she fell asleep.  Apparently, that's a developmental milestone.

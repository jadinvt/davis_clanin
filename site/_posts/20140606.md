<p>New Game(s)!  In the first one, Honora attempts to throw anything in her grasp outside of the range of her grasp.  We played for quite awhile, and (as usual), by the time it occurred to me to take a video, we had about 20 seconds left.  Honora is also beginning to play the passing-stuff-back-and-forth game.  There's an instance of one variety at the very end of the video--this move is called, "Here take this . . . no, I'll keep it."</p>

<p>Honora is, naturally, interested in our phones.  Rather than keep them away from here, I've adopted a strategy of "logging out" of the phone and letting her play with the pass code screen, which is like a really crummy drawing application.  The phone is in what has thus far proven to be an indestructable case; all is well.  It has a feature though, where shaking the phone turns on the camera.  I've probably deleted a few hundred pictures of blurs and blackness over the past 6 months or so.  Every now and then, there's a cute one though.</p>

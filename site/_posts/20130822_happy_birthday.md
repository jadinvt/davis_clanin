## Part Three: Happy Birthday, Honora!

Liane arrived and recommended “laboring down”, meaning waiting for the baby to come down the birth canal on her own some before beginning active pushing.  It was surreal because at this point, we just had a normal conversation about life and things for about an hour while the pressure in my bottom slowly increased. Around 7PM Liane said we could try pushing.  My day nurse Cegie’s shift was over, but she mentioned wanting to stay for the birth since I was so close. 

That ended up being a really great thing because she became our photographer and took some really awesome photos of the birth that we will treasure forever! She also positioned the stand up mirror so that I could see myself pushing. I wasn’t sure I would want that but it actually was really good and helped me control and direct my pushing.  They had stirrups for my legs and handrails for me to grab while pushing.  They started directing me to push.  As soon as I started, it became obvious that baby was almost here. You could see a little of her head right away.  Even with the epidural, I was somewhat uncomfortable as the baby’s head moved down. 

I was pushing with all my might, pulling on the handrails as hard as possible.  I was incredibly sore the next day! I was more sore than after a weightlifting class! After only an hour of pushing, baby’s head crowned and she was born and they placed her on my chest right away. Jad and I cried tears of joy of course and it was very poignant and emotional just like you would expect.

Jad actually helped “catch” the baby as she came out and he also cut the umbilical cord after it stopped pulsating.  It turned out I had second degree tear and Liane stitched me up, another reason I’m glad I had the epidural. The baby stayed on my chest for a while and I even nursed her a little bit in that first hour or so.  

To Jad and I, it was a perfect birth.  I was totally able to focus on pushing her out and comfortable enough to enjoy her birth and the bonding afterward. Jad was incredibly sweet and very helpful the entire time. He was always right by my side, being totally supportive. Having spent months worrying, dreaming and talking about Honora’s birth, it was hard to believe that it was already over and that she was actually here! It was an amazing start to our lives together and we were so incredibly grateful for our beautiful and healthy baby girl.

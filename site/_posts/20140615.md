title: Clapping and Laughing

<p>In our first feature, I've got Honora giggling pretty good.  She's a pretty tough customer when it comes to giving out giggles; it's good to have found something that she find reliably amusing.

I was attempting to capture Honora's newest physical feat, clapping.  She's got the general idea, but this morning was the first time she was making a real sound.  For the video, however, she's more interested in her ball.  She tries clapping with the ball, and then, when I have the ball, she threatens to clap a couple of times, but then decides that she'd rather play pass-the-ball.

<p>1 Year stats are in.  Honora weighs 17 3/16 pounds and is 28 1/4 inches tall.
She's about as small as a healthy 1 year old can be, but she's on the chart
and growing; all is well.

<p>Other than the clean bill of health, the highlight of the trip was a toy guitar
that Honora was playing with while we waited.

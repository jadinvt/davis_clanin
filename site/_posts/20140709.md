<p>
We drove the short distance to Bristol on the TN/VA border.  Alisa's cousin Josh and his wife Kristi had invited us to stay with them for a few days and let Honora hang out with her elder (by 1 month) cousin, Townes.

Gramma and Grampa came over to visit later that evening.  I think Honora remembered them--they hit it off immediately.

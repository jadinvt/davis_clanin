title: Figuring Things Out
---
Day 1 started off really early, as early as possible, in fact.  At 0 hour, we were still in the delivery room waiting to be moved to a postpartum room.  Not too long into the 23rd, Elizabeth and I shuttled Alisa, Honora (in a bassinet[^1]), and our cart-o-gear to the postpartum room. 

Next on the to-do list was a fairly long teach-in from our next nurse, Marla.  She was sympathetic to Alisa's exhausted state, but had to deliver her spiel verbatim none-the-less.

Like all our nurses[^2], Marla's help was essential.  She patiently showed me how the hell to change a diaper (I've since become a journeyman diaper changer), to care for the remaining umbilical cord, to suction spit-up amniotic fluid out of Honora's mouth and how to log all the inputs and outputs to monitor for any abnormalities.

There wasn't much sleep for the rest of the overnight hours.  Every sound Honora made had us awake and me jumping off the couch.  Luckily, this was our first long night since the birth happened in one day.  Alisa was obviously physically exhausted from the delivery, but I had some gas in the tank still.

The rest of the day was blissful.  We were waited on hand-and-foot by the hospital staff and spent most of the day holding our baby and marveling at our fantastic luck.

Later in the afternoon, Honora met Aunt Heather and Uncle Eric and . . .cousin? Maya.  They brought dinner (cheeeeseburgers) and we passed the baby around and played with Maya-Papaya.

At some point we filled out the ridiculously long form for the Texas Department of State Health Services birth certificate, without which we would have had to leave our child behind at the hospital. 

Our next Nurse was Debbi, who helped Alisa with breastfeeding, and was, like everyone, very kind, helpful, and understanding[^2].

[^1]: Nobody is allowed to carry babies in the hallway; this is intended to make baby stealing--which I didn't even realize was a thing--that much harder.

[^2]: A general note: I was really impressed with how cool the nurses were with me following them around when they took Honora for her weighing, measuring, poking and prodding (medical poking and prodding).  They always explained what they were doing, were open to questions, and didn't bat an eye at our hippie/paranoid requests (no bath, no hepatitis-B vaccine, no social security number, etc.)

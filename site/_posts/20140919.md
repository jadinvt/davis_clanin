<p>When she first began to crawl (way back last month), one of Honora's first activities was <a href="/stories/2014/08/11/all-terrain-honora/">crawling back and forth across my legs</a>.  Now, we play the same game, but she pulls to stand on me and then launches herself as far as she can (not very far) and kicks her way the rest of the way over me.  It's pretty fun.</p>

<p>The Thinkery was closed, so we played around the lake.</p>

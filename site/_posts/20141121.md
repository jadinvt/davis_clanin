title: Brief Visit to the Texas History Museum
---
<p>
We had a fairly mild preview of toddlerhood today.  Historically, at least for the last year
Honora has been pretty content, on our outings, to hang out in the carrier and take in her surroundings.
This time, though, it was only 20 minutes or so before she wanted to get down and crawl.  Unfortunately,
the Texas History Museum was lousy with hopped-up 7 - 14 year old school kids who seemingly hadn't been
out of a classroom in months.  We let Honora take a brief scoot through the space program exhibit, but that
was all we could manage.  We depleted our Cheerio reserves over the next 30 minutes, and then made a squirmy 
exit.  We let her crawl around on the plaza outside, and she scootched about 50 yards before we  thought
better of letting her crawl barefoot.  We picked her up and headed out for pizza.

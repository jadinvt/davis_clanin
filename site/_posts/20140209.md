<figcaption>Hey you there.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Like my shirt?</figcaption>
</figure>

<img src="/img/2014/02/09/img_1700_medium.jpg" />
<figcaption>Yeah, thanks. I think it's pretty cool.</figcaption>
</figure>

An example of Honora reaching for things.  She'll only reach for objects (ex. blocks, keys, dog heads, beards, noses) that come in range.  I'm guessing she'll start tractor-beam style cross-room demand-reaching shortly.

<figcaption>This is how you deal with a block!</figcaption>

<figcaption>The best thing about N. Carolina is not being there during a polar vortex--at least until Honora can ski (shooting for winter 2016-17).</figcaption>

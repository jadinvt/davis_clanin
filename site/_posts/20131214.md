title: Sitting Up / White Elephant Party

Honora's balance is getting stronger.  Her neck is under control and now she's working on her upper body.  The exploration of sitting is funny, every minute or two some random motor signal will fire and she'll fold in half forward or lean/fling herself sideways.

Today we went to the annual Nathanson-Flowers White Elephant party.  I was with Honora making food for the event when she ripped the owl (center) off of his velcro roost.  We reattached him and watched for a repeat.  She grabbed onto the owl a bunch more, but never gave him a sufficient yank.

Somehow Stephen is holding Honora during her best event-pics.

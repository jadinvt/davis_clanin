title: Nice Cool Day at Mueller

On this day, we started our walk a bit earlier because *somebody* was vocally unhappy with her Paco's Tacos experience (it was Alisa).

By the time we got going on our walk, all was well.  It was a lovely day and we wrapped up by sitting next to the "lake" for a bit.

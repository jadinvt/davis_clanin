Today we go all dressed up to go to the doctors office.  The most traumatic part was putting on pants (I could totally empathize with Honora on this one).  Once we got to the doctors, all gussied up, the first step was to disrobe to the diaper.  Tangentially, there's really no option here; the car seat requires that a baby's arms and legs be separate (i.e. no swaddling).  It seems there's a conspiracy against newborns traveling comfortably.

When we got back, Bessie had to check that Honora was OK and try to determine where she'd been (conclusion: some place with no dogs).

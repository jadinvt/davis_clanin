No photographic evidence, but Honora watched her first Superbowl today.  We were at Heather and Eric's and the place was overrun by ~4 year olds.  It was pretty adorable.  Honora was somewhat overwhelmed, but let us stay until half-time (which was long enough to guess who was going to win).  Honora got to meet Cindy, Luis and Sarah and got a big hug and kiss from the Brazillian Viking, Inajara.  She was passed around briefly, but came back to the crook of my left arm in fairly short order.

Here she is, probably beforehand, relaxing in the Jungle.

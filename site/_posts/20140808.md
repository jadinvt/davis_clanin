title: Crawling/Jojo's Ball
---
<p>Our dogs are pretty smart.  They've never tried to play with Honora's toys.  Occasionally, Honora gets ahold of one of their toys.  We usually intervene in these cases, since, while probably harmless, it's nevertheless gross when Honora shared a chew toy with Jojo.  Today, though, there was a pretty cute, short-range game of fetch going on.  Jojo was turning on full steam to travel the 3 or 4 feet that Honora rolled/through the ball, she would bring it back and Honora would throw it again.

<p>All that to say, Honora was pretty taken with this magic dog-controlling ball she'd discovered.  And, after much frustration and effort, took her first sliding-crawling "steps" motivated to retrieve it.</p>

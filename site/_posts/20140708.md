title: Honora Maighr√©ad 2014 South-East Tour (Day 1)
---
<p>
We're heading back to visit Alisa's and my parents and a few dozen Taylor cousins from Alisa's Mom's side of the family.  Starting from the Taylor homeland in NE Tennessee, we'll tour around the Appalachian mountains, specifically Bristol, NC/VA; Asheville, NC; Sky Valley, GA; and finally Knoxville, TN.  Two weeks on the road, all said.

This was a somewhat daunting undertaking (spoiler alert: it was pretty easy).  We packed not unreasonably, but we still had our hands full.  Even after dropping off the checked luggage, we were still pretty encumbered.

Besides the anticipated hassle of having all of our equipment and baby hand searched (which didn't happen, we were basically waved through), my #1 concern was the pressure change on take off.  A bottle, apparently, helps babies' ears adjust.  It seemed to work and Honora had no trouble at all with the flight.

All our stuff made it to Nashville and we jumped in our rental car and headed east.

The Neubauers (who we'll see on the 21st) are our traditional first stop in Tennessee.  They were on vacation, but had stashed a Pack-and-Play (mobile crib) and a handy travel high-chair in their garage for us to pick up on our way to Bristol.  While we were coming into Knoxville, it began to thunderstorm.  The Neubauers had left their garage door open; we gave them a call to let them know and, hearing the rain, invited us to stay at their place for the night

All that to explain whose bath toys Honora is playing with:

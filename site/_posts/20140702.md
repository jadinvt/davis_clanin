When Honora started to roll as a means of moving, we put our mattress on the floor.  It's become another play area.  For some reason, Honora loves to roll/scoot around the mattress more (it seems to me) than on her play mat or anywhere else.  It also makes for more comfortable playing (emphasis on the laying) for adults.

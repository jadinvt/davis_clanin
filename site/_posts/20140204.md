This might just be coincidence.  Ever since the Mother at [Torbin's Birthday](/stories/2014/01/18/torbenmas/) warned that, after
big outings with lots of strangers, baby's wake up in the middle of the night, I've been keep an informal eye out.  After the 
[Superbowl](/stories/2014/02/02/superbowl), Honora slept fine.  The next night (last night), she woke up at 12am, 1.30am, 3.30am and 5am.  
She then proceeded to have a very sad day, which is a break in an otherwise good sleep/mood stretch going back to [her 5 month mark](/stories/2014/01/22/5-months-old/).

title: 1st Solar Birth Month
---

For short spans of time the solar calendar seems more arbitrary than the lunar.  Nevertheless, by virtue of being born in a 31 day month, here we are 31 days later celebrating her first solar birth-month.

Kent came over to join the festivities and the three of us had a nice long chat about life, the universe and everything.

### Milestones
* First solar birth month.
* First hardcore dronefest.  Honora is soothed by my monotone explanatory voice.  Kent has a similar manner of speaking.  Honora slept through about 2/3rds of our conversation.

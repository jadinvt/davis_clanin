## Part One: Prelude

It was Wednesday, August the 21st, the evening before my due date. I was generally feeling good, but uncomfortable with the late stage of pregnancy. I was happy to know that I had made it full term but anxious about going overdue for a long period of time.  They had transferred most of my duties at work to other case managers so I had spent much of the day preparing for baby. I was cleaning, doing laundry, organizing baby things and such. I also had a bit of an online shopping spree as the stack of boxes when we returned from the hospital showed. I'm totally blaming that on nesting.  

I wasn't sleeping much those nights, I was staying up until around 1 AM cleaning and surfing the web. At 11:45 that evening, I bent down in the bathroom to pick up a piece of clothing off the bathroom floor. I felt a "pop" in my stomach and then a gush of fluid. I yelled for Jad several times and ran out into the living room yelling "my water broke! my water broke! my water broke!"  It was funny because they had told us in birthing class that this didn't happen very often (and I knew that from being a nurse) and it would not be like "in the movies."  Typically, the membranes rupture well after labor has started. But for me, it totally was the stereotypical water breaking scene, minus being in public and a panicked rush to the hospital with the doofy husband for comic effect.

I called my midwife Liane, who was very calming and reassuring. She recommended trying to get some sleep and waiting to see if labor would start on its own overnight. She said they were comfortable waiting 18 hours after rupture before inducing.  I was initially feeling bad about my water breaking, wondering if I had not drank enough water that day or caused it somehow. I was afraid that I was going to need to be induced and possibly end up with more and more medical interventions ending in a c-section. However, I also knew that birth is birth, unpredictable and uncontrollable.  I was trying to not beat myself up too hard and focus on that fact that I had made it full term with a healthy pregnancy.

I took a tylenol PM and laid down to try and sleep. I woke up a few times in the night with mild contractions, but nothing serious. I called the obgyn office that morning and they recommended to come in and get checked and formulate a plan. We knew we might be going to the hospital after the visit so we did a quick walk around the block, took some pics and loaded up the car.  We got the office and Dr. Blake did a quick check on me, I was actually 3 cm dilated and 50% effaced, more than I expected since I wasn't really contracting! It was 10:30 AM on my due date at this time. We discussed me going on in to the hospital and starting low dose pitocin to see if my body would kick into labor. Given that it had been 10 hours since my water broke and I had not started really contracting I thought this was reasonable. I knew the clock was ticking at this point and I would rather have my labor started during the day than heading into the overnight period, meaning another night of poor or no sleep.  

Jad and I drove over and parked at the hospital. We stopped to laugh and take a picture of a "Expectant Mother Parking Only" sign with a motorcycle behind it.

I was feeling a little anxious but excited.  We got shown to our room, and a nurse started the admission. The room was nice, low warm lighting, hardwood floors, wood furniture. The Women's Center at St. David's is a fairly new facility, opened in 2010 I think. The only thing that would make it better is if they had jacuzzi tubs like at the birthing center, that was the only thing I was a little sad about. Although as it turned out I probably couldn't have used that anyway since I was ruptured. We had the charge nurse and a nurse new to the hospital checking me in, it took a long time going through the multiple screens on the computer filling in all of my health history information.  They were very nice but they did joke that I might see the breakfast tacos I had eaten that morning again later in the day. I didn't care, the tacos were good and I needed to eat! Eventually they completed my admission and began the process of getting my IV started, my blood drawn, and getting me hooked up to the monitors (baby's heartbeat and uterine contractions.)  We met our nurse for the day, Cegie. She seemed young to me but it became obvious she was very competent and I was pleased.  They finally started the pitocin around 1:00 PM. Then the real fun began!

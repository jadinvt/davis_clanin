title: Punch you out!

For the last few days Honora has been keeping somewhat regular hours at night.  She goes to bed around 10pm and gets up around 4am to eat.  I, unfortunately, am still getting up around 2; my internal clock hasn't adapted yet.

Today after she was crying, she had a tear in her eye.  That's the first time I'd seen that (it was very sad).

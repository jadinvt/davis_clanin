A scheduled visit, actually, no call necessary.  Leane came by to do a two week checkup on Honora and Alisa.  Everyone got a gold star.

I predict many Honora-and-Dog photos since the dogs are always in close proximity to our feet and Honora likes laying on the carpet/blankets.  In this one, I had to resort to changing Honora on the ground after a series of catastrophes on the changing table.  Of course, Jojo is right there.  I'm not sure if she's "looking at" Jojo or if that's just the direction her head and eyes are pointing.  I haven't seen her intentionally look at or follow objects.  I need to refresh my ancient child development knowledge.

So far we only have one anarcho-onesie, courtesy of Aunt Erin and Uncle Alex.  Luckily, we've got plenty of room to grow into it!

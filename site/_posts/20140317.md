Just like everybody predicted, the oxytocin hit provided by a 6 month old Honora is incomparably higher than that of the 4 month version.  I would never have believed it, but it's true.  With the talking and the grabbing and the nearly sitting up, it's hard to do anything else but play with her.  Also, she has a strong preference that we play with her.

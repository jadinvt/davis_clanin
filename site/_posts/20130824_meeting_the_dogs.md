title: Meeting the Dogs

At some point, it occurred to me that I should look up how to introduce the dogs to Honora; but I hadn't done it by the time we got home from the hospital.  I'd kept the car seat on the table while Honora woke up.

Not too long after she woke up, I took her for a diaper change.  After I had her naked and squalling I realized that, not being in the hospital, I didn't have any diapers or wipes ready on the changing table; they were on the bottom shelf, unopened.  I picked up Honora in my left arm and knelt down to grab/open the supplies.  After a few seconds I looked back over my shoulder to find the dogs observing in an uncharacteristically chill manner.

Who knows what dogs know and how strong our bias to anthropomorphize is, but they seemed to recognize, at least, that this was something not to be trifled with or bowled over with their usual exuberance.  Jojo (the older dog) was the same way with Bessie when Bessie was an 8 week old puppy--at the time, Jojo was 3 and exploding with energy, but was very gentle with the new puppy.

Over the next day or two, we've left Honora resting in her car seat or vibrating chair at ground level.  So far the dogs have been very cool.  Bessie, the licker, has even limited herself to a couple of licks on Honora's feet.  I still need to look up the right way to do this so I can see how badly I've messed it up :p

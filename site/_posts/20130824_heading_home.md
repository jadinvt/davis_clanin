title: Heading Home
---
While the hotel-like accommodations at the hospital were nice, and the instruction/assistance from nurses essential, we were ready to head home on Saturday.  We had a series of check boxes to fill out yet.
   
#### Medical assessment, Baby
For the fourth and final time, I followed the nurse (Lori covered our final shift--another in an unbroken line of excellent medical professionals) to the nursery.  The last gauntlet for Honora to pass, besides the usual weighing and temperature-taking was a [series of blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newborn_screening) which involved the nurse pricking Honora's heel and squeezing drops of blood for what seemed like an eternity onto a piece of paper with five circles.

She was also tested for jaundice which the 10 soiled diapers of the previous day and her cartoon-pink complexion lead me to believe she didn't have.  Sure enough, she scored sufficiently non-jaundiced to warrant a retest (so advanced!)
##### Result: **Passed**

#### Medical assessment, Mama

Next came the final round of mashing on Alisa's formerly baby-containing abdomen.  Blood pressure check, temperature gauging, etc.
##### Result: **Passed**

#### Break for Breakfast Tacos

Tia Aimee brought breakfast tacos and hung out with us for awhile.

#### Bureaucratic hurdle (low)
The next check box was to make sure we'd filled out our request to take our child home correctly.  
##### Result: **Passed**

#### Medical assessment, Baby
This time by the hospital pediatrician.  No problem, since Honora is, by this point, a skilled test taker.
##### Result: **Passed**

While Honora got dressed up in her first non-blanket outfit and duly photographed, all the paperwork was assembled by Lori, our last friendly, super-helpful nurse (who also carried/carted all our stuff out while I only had the car carrier--which she'd showed me how to use).

The next thing we knew, we were in our car taking a baby home.  The whole birth/recovery process was pretty nice, especially since we had no idea what we were doing.  We didn't feel up to a non-hospital birth primarily because our age is correlated with birth/postpartum complications and we had no idea how Alisa was going to handle the physical trauma of labor.  A nice secondary gain was all the instruction and shortcuts we learned from the medical staff.  It would have taken alot of YouTube/Googling to provide the same amount of knowledge.

### Milestones
* First time wearing pants.
* First time outside (I tried to show her Texas, but she was mostly sleeping).
* First car ride.

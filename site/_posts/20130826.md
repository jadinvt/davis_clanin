title: End of the Umbilical
---

Not too much of note today.  Just another wonderful day chilling with Honora.  I noticed while changing her that she can hold her legs in an extended position--which looked hilarious.  Also, it's now possible to straighten her arms--it may have been possible before, but I wasn't going to push it.

The highlight of the day was the demise of her umbilical stump and the emergence of an adorable belly-button.  I don't have an appropriate image from the day, so here are some random cute pictures instead.

<p>With Summer fast approaching and the prospect of our walking hours being limited to 11pm - 5am, we decided to take the plunge and get a pass to "The Thinkery," Austin's science museum.  Now you may be asking yourself, what can a pre-mobile 9 month old possibly do in a science museum.  The answer is: not much, but it's air conditioned.</p>
<p>
But first, we got lunch.

The museum actually does have a nice play area for infants/toddlers.  Not alot of science goes on in this part of the building, frankly, but it's got alot to see (and sit near) and do.  Here's where we landed for this, our exploratory first trip, a mirror "tent."

<p> All that science got us hungry, so we stopped for a snack at Contigo on our way home.  These destinations are too close to our house for our own good.</p>

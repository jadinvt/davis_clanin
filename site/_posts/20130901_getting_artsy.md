More adventures of posing Honora on items that we're not sure how to wash.  In this instance, a blanket from my Mom.

### Milestones
* First houseguest, Sarah Mu√±oz, who came bearing Turkey chili and cornbread muffins (devoured as of 9/4).
* Honora is definitely getting rounder.  Cheeks and thighs becoming chubbier.

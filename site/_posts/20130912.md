title: Back to the Doc and Kisses All Over
---
We went back to the pediatrician today.  Here are Honora's updated stats:
+ 7 lbs. 6 oz. (up 9.3% from 2 weeks ago, which puts my modest weight gain to shame)
+ 20 inches long. (5.3% increase)

Everything checked out, so she's free for 5 weeks or so.

Then home again for recovery.

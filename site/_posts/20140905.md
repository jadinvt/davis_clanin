title: The Little People Endeavor
---
<p>
Today, Honora decided that she wanted to have 3 Little People figures in her hands at
the same time.  This effort went on for 10 or 15 minutes.  Long enough for me to give 
up and go get a book to read (Alisa is the photographer here).  I didn't know how the 
ordeal would end, but I didn't predict victory.  Goes to show what I know.

being played here in a highchair.  Also pictured: Dolly in a repelling harness.</p>

title: Honora's walk around the block
---

Jad and I have been enjoying our time at home with the new baby but it was starting to feel like we were living in a biodome given that we are still having 100 degree heat and can’t really go outside.  This morning while it was still (relatively) cool we decided to venture out for a short neighborhood walk.

This was my first post pregnancy walk, and it felt fantastic! I could actually make it around the block without being totally out of breath and an aching back! I’m really looking forward to cooler weather and taking Honora around the town lake trail downtown.

title: Torbenmas!

Today is Torben's 5th birthday and we went over to Mike and Barbara's to celebrate.  Stu and Katja were visiting from Amsterdam as well; we haven't seen them in 3 or 4 years.  Right as we came into the house and were introducing Honora to Stu, she broke out in a full on wail.  I took her back outside and she was fine.  Our best guess is that the noise and all the people scared her (there were 30 or so people--it was pretty packed).  It was the first time she got upset at a social event other than from being tired.  

Our follow-on theory is that she can see better now than before and what was once a noisy blur is now a room of terrifying strangers.  Who knows?

In any case, we held audience in the back yard with a dozen frolicking 5 year olds and their parents.  One parent told us that Honora's sleep would be disrupted for the next few days.  Coincidentally or not, she woke up in the middle of the night on the 18th, 19th, and 20th.  

None of this has to do with the picture below.  Alisa's phone was dead, so no pictures of the party (a couple other folks took some, so maybe more will appear here later).  At ~11.30pm, I realized we hadn't taken any pictures today; I flipped on the light and took this one real quick.
